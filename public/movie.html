<h1>The Best movies according to Aishu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>Black Panther is a terrific success on its own, one that avoids the Marvel trap of unmemorable villains and generic soundtrack, and the superhero trope of sexualising female warriors. It tells a compelling story filled with three-dimensional characters, and in essence, packages an indie film with blockbuster wrapping. Coogler knows fully too well the reach of something like Black Panther, and he uses the Marvel canvas to paint a bigger but more importantly, a powerful picture.</p>
<h3>Kimi No Nawa</h3>
<p>It depicts the story of high school students Taki Tachibana and Mitsuha Miyamizu, who suddenly begin to swap bodies despite having never met, unleashing chaos on each other's lives. The film was inspired by Japan's frequency for natural disasters.</p>
<h3>Tomorrowland</h3>
<p> In the film, a disillusioned genius inventor and a teenage science enthusiast embark to an intriguing alternate dimension known as "Tomorrowland," where their actions directly affect their own world.</p>
